Some poor bastard posted [this script](http://pastebin.com/Ce9PTtFd) to
[/r/perl](http://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/qf9do/why_is_this_perl_code_painfully_slow/), asking for help improving its performance. They received a lot of
advice: some good, some terrible, most irrelevant. Since it looks like they're
new to Perl, I thought it might be helpful to clean up the code step-by-step.
